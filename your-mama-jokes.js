/**
 * The main idea of this code is we are going to be working with two different elements one that is going to be a display element and the other is going to be a button element. The main take away from all this is we are getting a list creating a function then listening for a click when the button is clicked and then running the function. The logic behind the function is simple get a random number then index it with list and then change the inner text to match it.
